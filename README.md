# Launch Page requirements
1. Contact Us section
2. Join the waitlist button -> get their name and email? / number ? or make account?
3. Take survey -> using TypeForm (better UI then google form) -> embed to our page

Idea : Let's not make seperate page for these 3 features in launch page. Just scroll down for that section
