# Youth Spot

## Steps for developers
1. Clone this github repository using VSCode
2. Install an extension called Todo List by the developer "this other thing"
3. Check the __todo file in the main path
4. Delete the todo task after completion. While committing, mention completed [task name].

## Catchy Line

## Launch Page requirements
1. Contact Us section
2. Join the waitlist button -> get their name and email? / number ? or make account?
3. Take survey -> using TypeForm (better UI then google form) -> embed to our page

Idea : Let's not make seperate page for these 3 features in launch page. Just scroll down for that section

## Main web features

### 1. Sign - in 

### 2. Find event through search (event discovery)
    -> Find by name, organization, type of event, or location (obviously within the campus, eg. hall)

### 3. Events
    -> Frame of the event - like a rectangle
        has it's photo, and name of the event at bottom
        the way BookMyShow has movie listing on it's homepage
